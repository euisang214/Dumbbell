Smartbell - Ethan Shin

This iOS application should launch either on an emulator or an actual iPhone. It is built for iPhone 6 and above. However, its main features will only function with a pair of powered Microbits. 

Nonetheless, the code so far is capable of connecting to the Microbits via bluetooth, measuring symmetry, range of motion, number of repetitions, and seconds per rep. The dials in which these statistics will be shown are still visible without connecting the Microbits.
